## *Todo App*

### /todo-app

>This is a small project built with Vue 3 and TypeScript.
>It demonstrates the basic concepts of Vue’s Composition API, including reactivity, event handling, and computed properties.
>The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, and stores them persistently using the browser’s localStorage.
>Additionally, it features task filtering (All, Active, Completed), showing how to use reactive variables and conditional rendering in templates.
>The main goal of this project is to get familiar with Vue 3 and TypeScript integration, understand how state is managed with ref and computed, and how to work with lifecycle hooks like onMounted and watch.
